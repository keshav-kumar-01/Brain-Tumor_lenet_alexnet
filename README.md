# Brain Tumor Classification Project

This project aims to classify brain tumor images into different categories using deep learning models such as LeNet-5 and AlexNet. The dataset used in this project contains MRI images of brain tumors categorized into different classes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the `Brain-Tumor-Classification-DataSet-master` directory. It consists of two subdirectories: `Training` and `Testing`. Each subdirectory contains images of brain tumors categorized into different classes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/keshav-kumar-01/Brain-Tumor_lenet_alexnet.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Run the code

4. After training, the models will be saved as `lenet_model.h5` and `alexnet_model.h5`.

## Results
- The performance of the LeNet-5 and AlexNet models is evaluated using accuracy, recall score, and confusion matrix metrics.
- Results and visualizations can be found in the  directory.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Explore ensemble methods for combining predictions from multiple models.
- Deploy the trained models for real-world usage.

## Credits
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keshavkumar101/brain-tumor
- The LeNet-5 and AlexNet architectures are based on their original implementations and adapted for this project.
